        <p>
          This paper studies how initial and variation margin requirements in futures markets affect
          Treasury yields and collateral demand. Using proprietary clearing data from CME, I show that
          margin shocks transmit to the convenience yield of short-term Treasuries.

        <h3>
          <a href="wp/MoneyMatters2023.pdf">Money Matters: Global Banks, Safe Assets and Monetary Policy Autonomy (2023)</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I propose a theory where the demand for global safe assets plays a critical role in the occurrence of various types of monetary policy spillovers. Monetary shocks of a hegemon currency issuer determine portfolio allocation of risk-averse global banks, international capital flows, and by this way (1) production, (2) aggregate risk and (3) optimal monetary policy within a non-hegemon economy. Because of general equilibrium effects, (4) non-hegemon's monetary policy responses indirectly affect global bank's incentives to hold hegemon's goverment debt --i.e. the global safe asset-- as well as hegemon's government welfare. This theory provides a novel framework that rationalizes and integrates various types of empirically documented monetary policy spillovers. Moreover, by shedding light on two-way spillovers, going both from the hegemon to the non-hegemon economy as well as the other way around, it also provides a headway on how to think potential gains of monetary policy cooperation. Understanding how the international demand for safe assets affects the international transmission of shocks is important for understanding the optimal design of monetary policy in an open economy.

          We document how non-bank financial institutions contribute to the pricing of
          Treasury securities, emphasizing their role in demand for safety and liquidity.
